00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,600
welcome to this video in the last video

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,600



3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:10,360
I created on webpack I showed you how

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,360



5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,599
you could add HTML and images to your

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,599



7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,930
workflow so how you can get web pack to

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,930



9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,760
copy your HTML file basically and some

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,760



11
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,920
of you asked if I could also show how

12
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,920



13
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,530
you could work with multiple HTML files

14
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,530



15
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,980
there are actually two great solutions

16
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:23,980



17
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,900
for that

18
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,900



19
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,730
now there are more solutions and you can

20
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,730



21
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,570
simply Google to find more but here are

22
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,570



23
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:34,420
my two favorite solutions I will use the

24
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,420



25
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,220
same plugin we used before the HTML web

26
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,220



27
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,460
pack plug-in in one of the two solutions

28
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,460



29
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:42,460
and the average solution I will use the

30
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,460



31
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,960
file loader to copy the HTML file so

32
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,960



33
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,470
let's have a look at about solutions now

34
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,470



35
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,780
I want to start with the HTML web pack

36
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,780



37
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,329
plug-in but for both solutions I

38
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,329



39
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,120
actually need an additional HTML file

40
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,120



41
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,670
right now I get my index.html file here

42
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,670



43
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,469
in the source folder and to keep it

44
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,469



45
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,829
simple I will simply add a second one

46
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,829



47
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:05,470
which it will name users dot HTML now

48
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:05,470



49
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,510
whatever name you like of course now

50
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,510



51
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,810
this file exists in this folder too

52
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,810



53
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:13,780
obviously and now of course I want to be

54
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,780



55
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:17,320
able to well visit this file in the end

56
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,320



57
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,630
so do you copy it into the dist folder

58
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,630



59
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,270
which we create I now need to go to my

60
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,270



61
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,000
website conflict or chess file and when

62
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,000



63
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,790
using the HTML web pack plug-in a very

64
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,790



65
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,720
simple way of using multiple HTML files

66
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,720



67
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:34,210
is to simply duplicate this plug-in call

68
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,210



69
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,090
here so I'll simply add a new one in

70
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,090



71
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:40,450
there like this and I here of course I

72
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,450



73
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,420
point to the users dot HTML file of

74
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,420



75
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,909
course this has downsides that you need

76
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,909



77
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,979
to know which HTML files you use at the

78
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,979



79
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:50,080
point of time you create your config so

80
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:50,080



81
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:53,409
it's not a very dynamic approach if

82
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,409



83
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,049
you've got an app here where you add one

84
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,049



85
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:57,759
or thousand HTML files then this might

86
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,759



87
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,799
not be the approach you're looking for

88
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,799



89
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,640
but if you have for example just the

90
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:03,640



91
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:05,920
index.html file and then a 404 HTML file

92
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,920



93
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,810
to handle such errors there's my PD

94
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,810



95
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,819
approach you are looking for now of

96
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,819



97
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,340
course if I just drop in a line like

98
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:12,340



99
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:15,300
this what this plug-in would do is it

100
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,300



101
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,180
would still create only one index.html

102
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,180



103
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,040
file and simply use users HTML as the

104
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,040



105
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,230
template now since it comes second here

106
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,230



107
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,750
so that of course is not the behavior

108
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,750



109
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,870
one so I will give these files created

110
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,870



111
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,530
by the plug-in explicit file names I can

112
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,530



113
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,240
do this by adding the file name or

114
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,240



115
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,340
configuration or option here and we

116
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,340



117
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,200
could name this first one index.html

118
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,200



119
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,480
which is the name of the file you want

120
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,480



121
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,590
to copy and I'll keep the volume of the

122
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,590



123
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,410
second file too

124
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,410



125
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,910
so name this users HTML of course you

126
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,910



127
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,960
could rename it to something else here

128
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,960



129
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:52,890
now with this setup here you can now run

130
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,890



131
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,380
npm run build to start your web tag dev

132
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,380



133
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,440
server again and if you now with it

134
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,440



135
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,780
localhost 8080 you see the index.html

136
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,780



137
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,910
file we created in the last video and

138
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,910



139
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:08,790
now if we wizard users HTML well we

140
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,790



141
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,460
don't see anything here but this error

142
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,460



143
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,610
which I guess makes sense because what

144
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,610



145
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,370
happens the HTML plug-in here

146
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,370



147
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,489
copies the user's HTML file creates the

148
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,489



149
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,110
users HTML file which we do find if this

150
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,110



151
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,810
would not be the case so if we try to

152
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,810



153
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:29,310
find a file which doesn't exist we get

154
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,310



155
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,860
this error here so we do find the file

156
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,860



157
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:37,080
but in the file if we have a look at the

158
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:37,080



159
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:39,120
Dom let me increase this you see that it

160
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,120



161
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,190
still tries to import our bundle and

162
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,190



163
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,040
that is just what the HTML plug-in does

164
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,040



165
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,989
it does not just copy a file it also

166
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,989



167
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,470
injects your bundle into it that's the

168
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:49,470



169
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:52,980
idea behind this template now what you

170
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,980



171
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:56,190
can do here is you can add the chunks

172
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,190



173
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:59,580
options at this to an empty array let me

174
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,580



175
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:02,220
restart this server here and I will

176
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,220



177
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,170
reload this page and now you see we

178
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,170



179
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,690
don't get an error here in the console

180
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,690



181
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,060
because now we also don't try to import

182
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,060



183
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,360
this because what's the chunks option on

184
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,360



185
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,640
this plug-in you can define which chunks

186
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,640



187
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,280
you will which build artifacts so to say

188
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,280



189
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,370
should be injected into that edgy HTML

190
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,370



191
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,250
file so for the first one index.html if

192
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,250



193
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,990
we go back to that page you see it's

194
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,990



195
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,419
still injected everything because there

196
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,419



197
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,810
we don't specify chunks but here since

198
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:28,810



199
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,570
we set chunks to an empty our

200
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,570



201
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,550
it doesn't check anything now just to

202
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,550



203
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,800
complete the picture with these chunks

204
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,800



205
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,350
so now we use an empty array to tell it

206
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,350



207
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,780
well don't add any chunks what is a

208
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,780



209
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,090
chunk now if you would want to tell it

210
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,090



211
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,490
hey please include our bundle chairs

212
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,490



213
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,250
file here again we would need to define

214
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,250



215
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,220
entry a bit differently we could write

216
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,220



217
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,590
it as a JavaScript object here and set

218
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,590



219
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,540
app for example that's just the one

220
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,540



221
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,820
possibility you can choose any property

222
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,820



223
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,030
name you like here and now this would be

224
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,030



225
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,639
our app junk everything which is created

226
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,639



227
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,760
from this entry point here and then we

228
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,760



229
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,700
could define app here as a string and

230
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,700



231
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,970
now if I restart this server and we

232
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,970



233
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,400
wizard our users HTML file again and I

234
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,400



235
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,250
reload this you now see we get the error

236
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,250



237
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,590
again because now it injects this bundle

238
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,590



239
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,810
again so that is how we can control this

240
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,810



241
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,790
with chunks and how we overall with

242
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,790



243
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,460
chunks and the file name at the second

244
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,460



245
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,669
web peg plug-in call here can make sure

246
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,669



247
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,860
that we just copy that file again the

248
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,860



249
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:35,380
limitation of this approach clearly is

250
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,380



251
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,720
that we have to know which files we have

252
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,720



253
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,150
at the point of time we write this

254
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,150



255
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,330
configuration here and that might not be

256
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,330



257
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,460
the case for our setup so I will leave

258
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,460



259
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,850
it like this but there is only one

260
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,850



261
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,340
option we do have another one now for

262
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,340



263
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,070
this other option or comment out this

264
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,070



265
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,450
plug-in call a leaf to change on the

266
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,450



267
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,520
first one doesn't matter if we

268
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,520



269
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,800
explicitly named it index.html that

270
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,800



271
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,570
would have been the name anyways but now

272
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,570



273
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,810
I want to load that HTML files

274
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,810



275
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,880
differently from within our code so

276
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,880



277
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,010
let's say we don't know it at the point

278
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,010



279
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,660
of time we write our configuration but

280
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,660



281
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,750
certainly at the point of time we write

282
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,750



283
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,180
our app so then we could say we want to

284
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,180



285
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,110
load our users HTML file and I will

286
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,110



287
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,000
actually go in my app dot J's file

288
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,000



289
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:25,030
remember that it is in this file where

290
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,030



291
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,580
we also load our F CSS code so we're not

292
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,580



293
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,889
limited to including JavaScript here we

294
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,889



295
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,660
can also include other assets of which

296
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,660



297
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,389
you want to make web pega where

298
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,389



299
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:38,050
basically so what we can do here is we

300
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:38,050



301
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:42,500
can also import our HTML file so we

302
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,500



303
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:45,710
could say import and now go up one level

304
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,710



305
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,840
then not en excuse me the users HTML

306
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,840



307
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,690
file like this now that looks super

308
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,690



309
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,240
strange but this will actually work as

310
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,240



311
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,610
you will see so now I'm importing that

312
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,610



313
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,100
but of course web peg doesn't know how

314
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,100



315
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:01,430
to handle this so let's go to the web

316
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,430



317
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,790
peg config and here I will copy my rule

318
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,790



319
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,400
I created four images

320
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,400



321
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:10,520
we'll simply add it below there and here

322
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,520



323
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,750
I want to check for HTML files and you

324
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,750



325
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,060
could of course also change this

326
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,060



327
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,760
expression to also to take HTM files

328
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,760



329
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,100
so that's HTML and I'm going to use the

330
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,100



331
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,430
file loader I want to keep name and

332
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,430



333
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,400
extension but the output path it should

334
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,400



335
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,380
just be slash and the public path

336
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,380



337
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,180
therefore to which I don't need to

338
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,180



339
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,490
specify so actually we can omit the

340
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,490



341
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,500
output pop to now what's the file load

342
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,500



343
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,590
rule setup I need to tweak it a little

344
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,590



345
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,370
bit though I need to add exclude to make

346
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,370



347
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,410
sure that I don't also copy the

348
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,410



349
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:46,040
index.html file because what we have to

350
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,040



351
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:48,440
keep in mind here is that we do include

352
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,440



353
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,979
the index.html file into our web pack

354
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,979



355
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,900
build process right we do that here so I

356
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:53,900



357
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:56,060
need to exclude it and this actually

358
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,060



359
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,180
takes an absolute path so I'll use pop

360
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,180



361
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,790
resolve again your name and now we're

362
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,790



363
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,919
then in the source folder and then we

364
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,919



365
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,050
take the index.html file so don't want

366
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,050



367
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,300
to include this in my rule whoops should

368
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,300



369
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,430
be without that slasher down so with

370
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,430



371
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,430
this if we now restart and people run

372
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,430



373
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,120
build with this exclude thing edit your

374
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,120



375
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,100
overall HTML rule it should work that if

376
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,100



377
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,660
we now visit our page and I reload here

378
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,660



379
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,330
in XHTML still works

380
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,330



381
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:26,120
and if we go to users HTML it seems to

382
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,120



383
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,490
find this file and let's now finally add

384
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,490



385
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:32,750
at least some content to it make this

386
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,750



387
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:35,599
maybe an HTML page users page and most

388
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,599



389
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,469
importantly let's add something here

390
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:38,469



391
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,000
into our h1 tag let's save this and

392
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:41,000



393
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,760
reload the page and we see the user's

394
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,760



395
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,760
page so this is now working and this is

396
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,760



397
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,780
how you could copy multiple HTML files

398
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,780



399
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:53,060
either by using the HTML web pack

400
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,060



401
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,589
plug-in if you know how many files it's

402
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,589



403
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,010
going to be at the point of time you

404
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:55,010



405
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:57,310
write

406
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,310



407
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,020
conflict you set up your workflow or

408
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,020



409
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,660
using the more dynamic solution where

410
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,660



411
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,360
the name port here is imported up here

412
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,360



413
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,220
and then the file loader now if you

414
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,220



415
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,870
search for it you'll find more and

416
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,870



417
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,510
different solutions may be solutions

418
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,510



419
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:15,370
which better fit your use case but that

420
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,370



421
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,370
would be two ways of doing it
